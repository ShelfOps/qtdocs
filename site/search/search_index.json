Fermenting \u00b6 Step one consists of Fermenting the fresh Ingredients. Place Cauldron over a Fire or other heat source Fill it with water Add Ingredients with a rightclick Wait a few minutes while they ferment Fill in glass bottles Use a clock on a cauldron, if you want to know the time the ingredients have been fermenting. Distilling \u00b6 Some Recipes don't need distilling. 1. Put the bottle with ferment into the brewing stand 2. Put glowstone dust as filter on top into the brewing stand (The filter will not be consumed) Aging \u00b6 A barrel is needed for aging. Minecraft Barrel | 6 Slots Starting in 1.14 the Minecraft-Barrel can be used for aging of a few brews. Simply craft and place the barrel and put the brews inside. You can also build bigger barrels. They can be built in two ways: Small barrel | 9 Slots Use 8 wooden stairs to build a barrel shape. Place a Sign on the lower right side and write \"Barrel\" in the upper Line: Message \"Barrel created\" should appear. Big barrel | 27 Slots Use 5 Fences, 16 Wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape. Attach a Spigot (Fence) and a Sign that has \"Barrel\" written on it: Message \"Barrel created\" should appear You may remove the Sign from the Big Barrel after creating it. Open the Barrel by clicking on it. Put the Bottles into the Barrels for aging. For every Minecraft Day, the brews will age a year. Depending on the Recipe, the Type of wood used for building the barrel may alter the quality of the aged Brew. The Minecraft-barrel is always of wood type oak. Locking the Barrel \u00b6 The Barrels can be locked and Protected by a variety of Plugins. To Lock your Barrel you can use: * [LWC Extended](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lwc-extended.69551/) Just use /cprivate on the sign of the Barrel * [BlockLocker](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/blocklocker.3268/) When creating the Barrel, write `[private]` on the first line and `Barrel` on the last line of the sign Supported Plugins for region Protection are: * WorldGuard * GriefPrevention * Towny * GMInventories * Landlord * ProtectionStones * ClaimChunk * Residence * And many others. For \"Residence\" and if your plugin doensn't work with Brewery, enable `useVirtualChestPerms: true` in the config For scripts, or to implement support for Barrels, the [BarrelAccessEvent](https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/blob/master/src/com/dre/brewery/api/events/barrel/BarrelAccessEvent.java) from Brewery can be used. Drinking \u00b6 The Amount of Alcohol inside the Brew will be applied to the player when drinking. Depending on the quality of it, that may have different effects. The Player may not be able to walk normally anymore, he will weave, making it almost impossible to walk straight Effects like Blindness, Confusion, Poison etc. occur The Chat will be altered depending on drunkeness, many things players write may be incomprehensible, sometimes it seems senseless Is the Alcohol particularly strong, it may have poisonous effects After drinking a lot, there is a chance of vomiting When logging off, the player may have difficulties reaching his character, thus some loggins shortly after may be denied After Overdrinking the player may faint (Disconnecting) Brew Sealing - for shop plugins \u00b6 You can just give your created Brews to other Players and they might even put them back into a Barrel to keep ageing them. But most Shop-Plugins require sold items to be exactly equal and this is where sealing comes in. Imagine it like putting a seal on the bottle. To sell Brews using Shop-Plugins, you will need to seal them using the Brew Sealing Table. It is crafted with 2 Bottles over 4 Planks Putting a Brew into the Sealing table will equalise it, making it equal to other Brews that have been brewed similarly. Sealed Brews cannot be aged or modified any further and they don't show their details anymore Only available on 1.14 and up. Use /brew seal on 1.13. Getting Sober \u00b6 After drinking it takes a while until the alcohol is completely gone. During that time the alcohol level is steadily decreasing. Also it can be decreased through consuming of items defined in the config. When logging off extremely drunk, it may happen that, if the player logs back in after a while, they may find themselves at an completely unknown Place in the middle of nowhere having no idea how he got there. But if they log back in after some hours or next morning, they will find themselves at /home, again without any memories. Also if the Alcohol was not of best quality, the player may face some bad type of hangover (slowness and hunger). Some recipes are more difficult to master, others rather easy. Thats also why some of the recipes here are kept a bit more vague.

Custom Heads \u00b6 If you are a builder looking to spice up your build, there are around 38k playerheads with custom textures at your disposal. You can do /hdb to view them all Smoothtimber \u00b6 You can take down entire trees 1 by chopping down the bottom block If you don't want the whole tree to go down just shift/sneak while breaking the block *: Logs placed by players do not go down when broken. Seasons \u00b6 Pretty much a gimmick feature, but you will notice different things in the world such as air/block colors changing, random animals, berries or flowers spawning and such. If you tame an animal in a season, they will despawn when that season ends. If you breed two animals, the baby stays and parents leave to buy milk. Editing sign contents \u00b6 Do /signedit and click on a sign to change what's written on the sign. May not work on Bedrock clients. Interaction Visualiser \u00b6 You will be seeing some funny chest/enchantment table and other crafting station animations usually showing you the progress of the said station or just looks cool. If you, per chance , don't like this, you can disable it by /iv toggle all <all>/<specific block> <true>/<false> Don't forget to choose between optional statements. while executing the command. Brewing Alcoholic Beverages \u00b6 Pretty simple yet complex. Read here if you are interested. This will only work on logs which generate naturally.

Play the game, level yourself up. You really don't need to spend extra effort on things to level yourself up; you will automatically gain XP by completing tasks that you usually do (like mining, excavating, fishing, fighting, running etc.) Simply play the game as you normally do, and watch certain chores become a lot easier with time. Each skill comes with 97 levels and each level gives you a little stat boosts alongside other various perks. You will unlock some abilities but I'll leave it to you to discover those \"abilities\". They can be found on /skills menu. P.S: bedrock players can't open some GUI menus such as /skills , sorry Stats \u00b6 Each individual skill gives you a tiny boost within 2 selected stats as you level them up. Those stats consist of: Strength \u27bd Increases attack damage Health \u2764\ufe0f Increases max health Regeneration \u2765 Increases health and mana regen speed Luck \u2618\ufe0f Increases luck attribute and double drop chance for common blocks Wisdom \u273f Increases experience gain, max mana, decreases anvil costs Toughness \u2726 Reduces incoming damage P.S: Mana is used for both skill abilities and Magic spells (more about that later) P.P.S: To use your abilities, you should use the interact button (right click for Java players, not quite sure for bedrock since it's available for a variety of platforms) Tip All skills and their descriptions can be found on the*** /skills menu Dynamic Mob Difficulty \u00b6 Yet another simplex mechanic which forces mobs to spawn with higher levels as you go further away from spawn. Their stats were balanced in order to feel harder, but not impossible. There is not a hard cap for maximum mob level. Bosses are not affected by this mechanic. Custom enchants \u00b6 To compliment vanilla enchants, we have around 230 new vanilla enchants alongside some \"artifacts\" and new curses. they can all be found here You can also use /enchantmenu or /enchantinfo <enchantname> to identify what an enchant does, or its incompatibilities. Machinery \u00b6 There are custom ores, items, armor, gear and magic stuff you can obtain from a funny plugin called Slimefun. You can build small (or large) pieces of machinery by looking up how to build the crafting stations from /sf openguide (or the guide book that's given to you when you first join, they are the same thing) and then create the recipes which are all listed on the slimefun guidebook. there are a lot to discover and you can even craft some vanilla items like tridents, or an elytra. There are also magic stuff that you can get into. I would explain them all one by one, but there's a 2k letter limit and that's nowhere near enough *Read the guide or pay someone to build the things for you * -> community moment Livemap \u00b6 There is a livemap that updates to the state of the world (seasons, new builds, terrain changes etc.) and can be accessed here . 3D (isometric) view takes more time to render, so you're advised to use flat view (2D) You can use this map to find a good place to yoink resources in, or follow other people vibing around. the world is 10kx10k and the map follows the same radius, displaying everything available to us as they are discovered on the map. Backpacks \u00b6 YOU CAN CRAFT 6 TIERS OF BACKPACKS YEEHAW HOW COOL IS THAT Their recipes are in /bprecipe , and all backpacks come with liquid tanks to store your liquids without wasting shit ton of space on individual buckets. You can't put backpacks in backpacks, sucks I know. Rev 3.1 Notes: Both /bprecipe and /bbp recipe are valid commands. /bprecipe was an alias added later to make the command more convenient. Update: Backpack recipes also appear in crafting tables now. Custom Nether & End \u00b6 When the server starts, you are free to go to any dimension you wish to go to. There are no restrictions, because those dimensions are also custom and you will feel the difficulty of them if you go early. That is why you're recommended to go there later in your playthrough, preferably with one or more people by your side. End is revamped to make you feel like a meaningless pebble in vast nothingness, and will feature (massive) new biomes just like nether. Custom World Generation \u00b6 You might be familiar with the name \"Terralith\", it's a popular world generation datapack and we will be using it for this server. Seasons were altered to be compatible with Terralith and almost every terralith biome will respond to the current season. This generation features a variety of things ranging from 1.18 Lush caves, new cave height (goes down below Y=0), goats, powdered snow and more. Dungeons & Adventurer's Guild (and Bosses) \u00b6 As you fight Elite Mobs and Bosses, you will collect new loot and Elite Coins. You can spend those coins, or sell your gear as well as buy new gear at Adventurer's Guild. At some point, you will need to level up your adventurer rank to attempt to fight better bosses, because the game hardlocks you from doing so unless you rank up. There is currently only one dungeon, named Sewers, but you are requested not to enter it as it is planned to be a community event where we can hopefully tackle the dungeon all together. I unfortunately don't have time to create any new dungeons, but if you happen to build one; let me know and we can add it to the server as an actual dungeon. Bosses \u00b6 You will notice mobs which spawn with larger health pools or overall higher stats ranging from defense to damage & range. Those are bosses. You will notice them most likely by their aura which usually has a meaning, for example: - Floating Anvils: Doesn't take knockback - Floating Arrows: Doesn't take arrow damage - Floating Glasspanes: This boss is invisible (creepers are a pain) - Floating Fire Particles: This mob wants to grill your buttcheeks. Bosses are divided into two categories, Elite Mobs & Bosses. Elitemobs are regular which have higher stats and possibly an aura. They have a base chance of dropping loot and they scale to your threat level (more about that later) Bosses also appear as regular mobs, but they usually have better gear and visible particle effects alongside abilities to make you feel pain. When a boss spawns in the world, you will see a notification in chat alongside an option to track them. They are usually extremely challenging and definitely should not be fought alone unless you have good gear. Guild Tier System \u00b6 The guild tier loot limiter limits the best loot a player can loot based on their guild tier. Math behind this system is roughly like this: [( Guild Tier ) * 10 ] So for example, at tier 5 you will be able to obtain up to tier 50 loot and mob level will be capped at 50. Adventurers Guild NPCs \u00b6 Guild Attendant (for upgrading guild ranks) Blacksmith (for buying procedurally generated items and selling drops from elite mobs) Special Blacksmith (for buying custom items and selling drops from elite mobs) Quest Giver (for browsing and accepting quests) (currently unimplemented) Combat Instructor (for giving tips about EliteMobs combat) Barkeep (currently unimplemented) Magic \u00b6 By far my favorite feature, you can cast spells using a personalized wand. First you need to craft a wand (the recipe will be in the recipe book when you can craft one) and then you will need to start earning SpellPoints by slaying mobs using spells (you will have a starter spell.) As you earn SP (spell points), you can upgrade your wand by using the interact button on an enchantment while holding your wand. You can also customize your wand's controls by interacting with the enchanting table. Right click with your wand to cast spells. Level up your spells by killing mobs with your wand. Magic.","title":"Starter Guide"},{"location":"guide/#there-are-few-unusual-key-elements-that-you-will-need-to-pay-attention-to","text":"Skills Dynamic Mob difficulty Custom enchants Machinery Livemap Backpacks Adventurers' Content Seasons","title":"There are few unusual key elements that you will need to pay attention to:"},{"location":"guide/#skills","text":"skills are pretty straightforward.

They are usually extremely challenging and definitely should not be fought alone unless you have good gear.","title":"Bosses"},{"location":"guide/#guild-tier-system","text":"The guild tier loot limiter limits the best loot a player can loot based on their guild tier. Math behind this system is roughly like this: [( Guild Tier ) * 10 ] So for example, at tier 5 you will be able to obtain up to tier 50 loot and mob level will be capped at 50.","title":"Guild Tier System"},{"location":"guide/#adventurers-guild-npcs","text":"Guild Attendant (for upgrading guild ranks) Blacksmith (for buying procedurally generated items and selling drops from elite mobs) Special Blacksmith (for buying custom items and selling drops from elite mobs) Quest Giver (for browsing and accepting quests) (currently unimplemented) Combat Instructor (for giving tips about EliteMobs combat) Barkeep (currently unimplemented)","title":"Adventurers Guild NPCs"},{"location":"guide/#magic","text":"By far my favorite feature, you can cast spells using a personalized wand. First you need to craft a wand (the recipe will be in the recipe book when you can craft one) and then you will need to start earning SpellPoints by slaying mobs using spells (you will have a starter spell.) As you earn SP (spell points), you can upgrade your wand by using the interact button on an enchantment while holding your wand. You can also customize your wand's controls by interacting with the enchanting table. Right click with your wand to cast spells. Level up your spells by killing mobs with your wand. Magic.","title":"Magic"},{"location":"pets/","text":"There are various ways to interact with your pet. But first, you will need to capture one. Here is how: How to capture a pet \u00b6 Find the animal you want to capture, it can be any friendly mob that you want to tame. Once you have your target in sight, approach them slowly. You will need them to be below a certain health treshold. I am not going to state it here, as I would like you to experiment with this mechanic. Once the target is below required treshhold, left click them with a leash (lead) and voila; the pet is now yours. Pet Skills \u00b6 Pets may learn several skills such as: Backpack This skill adds a Backpack to your pet. It can be opened by using the /petinventory command. Items in this inventory will not be dropped when the pet dies unless it's enabled in the skilltree skill settings. Items picked up by your pet will be added to this inventory. Line added by skill upgrade will add 9 extra slots (up to 54 slots). Beacon The Beacon skill transforms your pet in a walking and more powerfull beacon. For administration of the buffs the plugin uses a custom menu (see Beacon Buff Selection Menu) that can be opened with the /petbeacon command. By default this skill consumes food when it is active, that means the Saturation-Value decreases continuously while the skill is active. Behavior With this skill you can change the behavior of the pet. There are 5 possible behavior-modes: Friendly -> Doesn't fight, even when attacked by anything Normal -> Like a neutral wolf. Aggressive -> Attacks everything within 15 blocks of the owner. Farm -> Atacks every Monster within 15 blocks of the owner Raid -> like normal but the pet doesn't attack players and their minions Duel -> pets will attack other pets with aktive duel behavior within a 5 block radius To toggle the mode type /petbehavior <normal/friendly/aggressive/farm/raid/duel> . Control With this skill you have more control about where you pet walk and what the pet attacks. To use this you have to rightclick with the Control item anywhere you want the pet has to walk to. The item for this skill is a stick. Damage This skill increases the damage the pet can do. 1 damage point equals to half a heart. Fire With this skill your pet has a chance to set targets on fire for a short period. Heal With this skill your pet heals skill itself every few seconds. Knockback With this skill your pet has a chance to knockback when attacking a target. Life This skill will increase the max hitpoints the pet can have. Lightning With this skill your pet has a chance to let a lightning strike at the target. Pickup With this skill your pet can pickup items (and XP) that lie on the ground. The items are added to the backpack of the pet. This skill can not be activated if the pet doesn't have the Backpack Skill with at least 1 row. Pickup can be enabled/disabled by using /petpickup command. Poison With this skill your pet has a chance to poison targets for a short period. Ranged With this skill your pet will shot projectiles at their targets that cause damage to them. Projectiles Arrow Egg Wither Skull Snowball Small Fireball Large Fireball All projectiles deal the same amount of damage that is set by the skill. The only difference is the trajectory of some projectiles. Ride With this skill you can ride your pet. To mount your pet right-click your pet with a lead. The controls while riding your pet is like you would ride a horse. Shield With this skill your pet can shield (some) damage from you and redirect it to itself. Slow With this skill your pet has a chance to slow his target down for a some seconds. Sprint With this skill your pet starts sprinting the first time it starts to follow a new target. Stomp With this skill your pet has a chance to stomp on the ground and damage all enemies around the pet. Thorns With this skill your pet has a chance to reflect the half of the incoming damage back to the damager. Wither With this skill your pet has a chance to wither his target for a some seconds. Hunger System \u00b6 Hunger System is based on saturation. The saturation is a value between 1 and 100, where 100 is the best and 1 is the worst. After a period of time the saturation decreases and affects other stats of your pet. In conclusion, feed your pet nerd. Hunger Points Hitpoints on Respawn 100-91 100% 90-81 90% 80-71 80% 70-61 70% 60-51 60% 50-41 50% 40-31 40% 30-21 30% 20-11 20% 10-2 10% 1 1 HP Skills Affected By Hunger \u00b6 Beacon The lower the saturation the less is the range of the beacon effect.
