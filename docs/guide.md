## There are few unusual key elements that you will need to pay attention to:

---

- Skills
- Dynamic Mob difficulty
- Custom enchants
- Machinery 
- Livemap
- Backpacks
- Bosses
- Seasons

---

## Skills
skills are pretty straightforward. Play the game, level yourself up. You really don't need to spend extra effort on things to level yourself up; you will *automatically* gain XP by completing tasks that you usually do (like mining, excavating, fishing, fighting, running etc.) Simply play the game as you normally do, and watch certain chores become a lot easier with time.
Each skill comes with 97 levels and each level gives you a little stat boosts alongside other various perks. 
You will unlock some abilities but I'll leave it to you to discover those "abilities". They can be found on `/skills` menu.

*P.S: bedrock players can't open some GUI menus such as `/skills`, sorry*

### Stats
Each individual skill gives you a tiny boost within 2 selected stats as you level them up. Those stats consist of:

  **Strength** ➽ Increases attack damage
  **Health** ❤️ Increases max health 
  **Regeneration** ❥ Increases health and mana regen speed
  **Luck** ☘️ Increases luck attribute and double drop chance for common blocks
  **Wisdom** ✿ Increases experience gain, max mana, decreases anvil costs
  **Toughness** ✦ Reduces incoming damage

*P.S: Mana is used for both skill abilities and Magic spells (more about that later)*

*P.P.S: To use your abilities, you should use the interact button (right click for Java players, not quite sure for bedrock since it's available for a variety of platforms)*

***P.P.P.S: All skills and their descriptions can be found on the*** ***`/skills`*** ***menu***

## Dynamic Mob Difficulty 
Yet another simplex mechanic which forces mobs to spawn with higher levels as you go further away from spawn. Their stats were balanced in order to feel harder, but not impossible. There is not a hard cap for maximum mob level.  Bosses are not affected by this mechanic.

## Custom enchants
To compliment vanilla enchants, we have around 230 new vanilla enchants alongside some "artifacts" and new curses. they can all be found [here](https://ecoenchants.willfp.com/enchantments/all-enchantments)

*You can also use `/enchantmenu` or `/enchantinfo <enchantname>` to identify what an enchant does, or its incompatibilities.*

## Machinery
There are custom ores, items, armor, gear and magic stuff you can obtain from a funny plugin called Slimefun. You can build small (or large) pieces of machinery by looking up how to build the crafting stations from `/sf openguide` (or the guide book that's given to you when you first join, they are the same thing) and then create the recipes which are all listed on the slimefun guidebook. there are a lot to discover and you can even craft some vanilla items like tridents, or an elytra. There are also magic stuff that you can get into. I would explain them all one by one, but there's a 2k letter limit and that's nowhere near enough

*Read the guide or pay someone to build the things for you *
-> community moment

## Livemap
There is a livemap that updates to the state of the world (seasons, new builds, terrain changes etc.) and can be accessed [here](http://151.80.47.38:8123/). 3D (isometric) view takes more time to render, so you're advised to use flat view (2D)

You can use this map to find a good place to yoink resources in, or follow other people vibing around. 
the world is 10kx10k and the map follows the same radius, displaying everything available to us as they are discovered on the map.

## Backpacks
YOU CAN CRAFT 6 TIERS OF BACKPACKS YEEHAW HOW COOL IS THAT
Their recipes are in `/bbp recipe`, and all backpacks come with liquid tanks to store your liquids without wasting shit ton of space on individual buckets. You can't put backpacks in backpacks, sucks I know. 

>**Update: Backpack recipes also appear in crafting tables now.**

## Custom Nether & End
When the server starts, you are free to go to any dimension you wish to go to. There are no restrictions, because those dimensions are also custom and you will feel the difficulty of them if you go early. That is why you're recommended to go there later in your playthrough, preferably with one or more people by your side.

End is revamped to make you feel like a meaningless pebble in vast nothingness, and will feature new biomes just like nether.

## Custom World Generation
You might be familiar with the name "Terralith", it's a popular world generation datapack and we will be using it for this server. Seasons were altered to be compatible with Terralith and almost every terralith biome will respond to the current season. This generation features a variety of things ranging from 1.18 Lush caves, new cave height (goes down below Y=0), goats, powdered snow and more.

## Dungeons & Adventurer's Guild (and Bosses)
As you fight Elite Mobs and Bosses, you will collect new loot and Elite Coins. You can spend those coins, or sell your gear as well as buy new gear at Adventurer's Guild. At some point, you will need to level up your adventurer rank to attempt to fight better bosses, because the game hardlocks you from doing so unless you rank up.

There is currently only one dungeon, named Sewers, but you are requested not to enter it as it is planned to be a community event where we can hopefully tackle the dungeon all together. I unfortunately don't have time to create any new dungeons, but if you happen to build one; let me know and we can add it to the server as an actual dungeon.

### Bosses
You will notice mobs which spawn with larger health pools or overall higher stats ranging from defense to damage & range. Those are bosses.  You will notice them most likely by their aura which usually has a meaning, for example:
- Floating Anvils: Doesn't take knockback
- Floating Arrows: Doesn't take arrow damage
- Floating Glasspanes: This boss is invisible (creepers are a pain)
- Floating Fire Particles: This mob wants to grill your buttcheeks.

Bosses are divided into two categories, Elite Mobs & Bosses.
Elitemobs are regular which have higher stats and possibly an aura. They have a base chance of dropping loot and they scale to your threat level (more about that later)

Bosses also appear as regular mobs, but they usually have better gear and visible particle effects alongside abilities to make you feel pain. When a boss spawns in the world, you will see a notification in chat alongside an option to track them. They are hard and definitely should not be fought alone unless you have good gear.

### Guild Tier System
The guild tier loot limiter limits the best loot a player can loot based on their guild tier.
Math behind this system is roughly like this:

```sh 
[(Guild Tier) * 10]
```
So for example, at tier 5 you will be able to obtain up to tier 50 loot and mob level will be capped at 50.

### Adventurers Guild NPCs
Guild Attendant (for upgrading guild ranks)
Blacksmith (for buying procedurally generated items and selling drops from elite mobs)
Special Blacksmith (for buying custom items and selling drops from elite mobs)
Quest Giver (for browsing and accepting quests) (currently unimplemented)
Combat Instructor (for giving tips about EliteMobs combat)
Barkeep (currently unimplemented)

## Magic
By far my favorite feature, you can cast spells using a personalized wand. First you need to craft a wand (the recipe will be in the recipe book when you can craft one) and then you will need to start earning SpellPoints by slaying mobs using spells (you will have a starter spell.) As you earn SP (spell points), you can upgrade your wand by using the interact button on an enchantment while holding your wand. You can also customize your wand's controls by interacting with the enchanting table. Right click with your wand to cast spells. Level up your spells by killing mobs with your wand. Magic.
