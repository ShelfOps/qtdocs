## How to start?
When you first join the server, you will find yourself in the Hub (which later will be referred to as "Adventurer's Guild").
From here onwards, you will be spending most of your time in the wilderness, or Dungeons, but more about that later. Let's get to "how to start"

To teleport to the wilderness and begin your adventure, you will need to go talk to the "**Sorcerer**" NPC located a few steps away from you down the path. Simply right click to the Sorcerer and stand still for a few seconds. After a short teleportation delay, you will find yourself in the wilderness. Great, that was step one. From here onwards, you can begin your Survival adventure. Of course, with extra features. Let's talk more about those.

There are "few" unusual key elements that you will need to pay attention to. Mainly:

## Skills & Evolutions

### Skills
Skills are pretty straightforward. Play the game, level yourself up. You really don't need to spend extra effort on things to level yourself up; you will *automatically* gain XP by completing tasks that you usually do (like mining, fishing, fighting, running etc.) Simply play the game as you normally do, and watch certain chores become a lot easier with time.
Each skill comes with 50 levels and each level gives you a little stat boosts alongside other various perks. 
By default, those are the skills you can level up

*P.S: bedrock players may not be able to open some GUI menus such as `/skills`, sorry*

!!! warning ""
    Skills play a major role in your gameplay. You will notice how the difficulty of the game will go up or down based on which skills you've chosen to level up. I recommend keeping an eye on and possibly prioritizing the stats certain skills provide bonuses on to be able to tackle certain challenges, such as [Dungeons](), become a lot easier.
    Below you will find the benefits of each stat, hope it helps you plan out your journey.

#### Stats

Each individual skill gives you a tiny boost within 2 selected stats as you level them up. Those stats consist of:

- **Defense** • Reduces Incoming Damage
- **Strength** • Increases Outgoing Damage
- **Crit Chance** • Increases the chance to deal a crit
- **Crit Damage** • Increases crit damage
- **Speed** • Increases movement speed
- **Wisdom** • Increases experience gain


!!! tip hint important 
    All skills and their descriptions can be found on the ***`/skills`*** menu.

### Evolutions
Evolutions introduce the mechanic of evolution to Minecraft, evolving unlocks new skills and boosts for yourself. Improvise, adapt, overcome.

There are 6 evolution environments. With them being:

- **Earth**
- **Nether**
- **End**
- **Ocean**
- **Cave**
- **Sky**

Each of these environments have unique skills that you can unlock by “evolving” in those environments. You evolve by gaining "Evolotion Energy". By *spending time* and *slaying mobs* in an environment you gain energy in that environment. Each skill requires a certain amount of energy to unlock. Hover over the book icon in each of the environment menus to view all of the ways to gain energy.

!!! tip 
    All evolutions and their descriptions can be found on the ***`/evo menu`*** menu.

## Reviving Players [Experimental]
You will die. A lot. The bosses and even their elite (weaker) counterparts are strong and they *will* kill you. But be not afraid! You can always revive your friends when they die, or then can revive you when you, well, **die**.
The process goes as follows: When a player is killed, they are not actually killed; they will be placed into a bleedout period where other players can try and revive the player who is downed. To revive a player, you need to hold sneak while standing really close to them until they are revived and they get back up. When a player is revived, they will be at half a heart. Do note that there is a bleedout timer, so you cannot leave the players hanging forever. After 1.5 minutes, the player will die. To end your own suffering, you can press `Sneak` (shift) to end bleedout and die as intended.

## Lumberjack
You can take down entire trees[^1] by chopping down the bottom block
If you don't want the whole tree to go down just shift/sneak while breaking the block

!!! fail ""
    You will not gain Woodcutting XP (See [Skills](#skills) above) from trees that you've chopped down automatically by breaking the bottom block. To level up your Woodcutting skill, you will need to **manually** chop down each block.

[^1]: This will only work on logs which generate naturally. If you would like to take down a custom-built tree or a pillar in your base made out of logs, you will need to do that manually. There are no workarounds.

## Seasons
Pretty much a gimmick feature, but you will notice different things in the world such as air/block colors changing, random animals, berries or flowers spawning and such. If you tame an animal in a season, they will despawn when that season ends. If you breed two animals, the baby stays and parents leave to buy milk.

Another thing is that there is a small winter mechanic with a temparature mechanic well on the way. Temparatures are not implemented, however, your crops will **not grow** during winter. Not at all. They will not *die*, but they will promptly stop growing until the next season (spring.)

## Machinery & Crafting
I've added many items and item modifiers to make this server more RPG-like and offer more freedom on how you approach combat. Below, you will find details on each new mechanic that's been added to the game. Some of them are experimental, so feedback is appreciated. 

### Slimefun
There are custom ores, items, armor, gear and magic stuff you can obtain from a funny plugin called Slimefun. You can build small (or large) pieces of machinery by looking up how to build the crafting stations from `/sf openguide` (or the guide book that's given to you when you first join, they are the same thing) and then create the recipes which are all listed on the slimefun guidebook. there are a lot to discover and you can even craft some vanilla items like tridents, or an elytra. There are also magic stuff that you can get into. I would explain them all one by one, but there is no point bloating this wiki with things that are more fun when discovered on your own. I highly recommend getting into slimefun machinery as soon as you can.

If things added by slimefun are complicated, you can always work together with someone who finds it easy or buy products from another player, forming a proper economy.


### Backpacks
YOU CAN CRAFT 6 TIERS OF BACKPACKS YEEHAW HOW COOL IS THAT
Their recipes are in `/bprecipe`, and all backpacks come with liquid tanks to store your liquids without wasting shit ton of space on individual buckets. You can't put backpacks in backpacks, sucks I know. 

**Notes**
>*Rev 3.1: Both `/bprecipe` and `/bbp recipe` are valid commands. `/bprecipe` was an alias added later to make the command more convenient.*

>*Rev 3.2: Backpack recipes will now appear in the crafting book when you open a crafting table.*


## Enchants, Reforges, Talismans & Extended Armory

### Custom Enchantment Books
There are around 240 custom enchants that can be applied to your weapon. Just like regular enchants, they can be found through enchanting tables, loot chests and villager trades. You can combine most of those enchants, but if you would like to see what conflicts with an enchant of your choice; run the command `/enchantinfo <enchant name>` or do `/enchants` to open a menu with a list of all possible enchants, spells curses and artifacts.

#### Enchants
Most of the books added through this plugin are enchants. They come in various shape on form, for a variety of tools; but what they do is simple, offer you a different way to play the game, be it through changing how you mine blocks or how you fight mobs. Enchants also have a few rarities, mentioned in [the Enchants List](../lists/enchants).

#### Spells 
Spells are not very common, and they offer less than enchants. They essentially apply a "skill" to your sword which you can use by using the interact button (right click by default). Some spells come with cooldowns, and they cannot be spammed. All Spells, alongside other Enchantment Books, are mentioned in [the Enchants List](../lists/enchants).

#### Artifacts
Artifacts apply visual changes to your tools. Sword artifacts activate on hitting mobs, pickaxe artifacts activate upon mining rare ores and so on. There is **1** rare armor artifact that is not mentioned in the wiki, whoever finds it (feel free to try as many times as you want) is in for a reward of their choice. :)

#### Curses
Nothing fancy, very similar to vanilla curses. They render your tools somewhat usable. Why would you apply one to your tools? Who knows. Curses will not come from enchanting tables and can be only obtained through loot chests/villager trades.

### Reforges
Reforges are enchant-like enhancements to your tools that need to be applied manually through a menu. You can run `/reforges` to open a menu where you can apply reforge stones.

The reforge menu is very simple to understand. The glass on the side goes green when there is a valid item that can be reforged in the left slot
*The anvil will show helpful messages.*

**Step One**
To reforge an item, put it on the left side of the menu. The right side is for reforge stones, which will be explained in the next section.

**Step Two**
The glass will then go green to indicate that a valid item has been entered.
*All reforgable items will say so in their lore (hover your cursor over the item).*

**Step Three**
Click the button to reforge the item, paying its cost. The price increases by a factor of 1.15x every time the same item is reforged.

### Talismans

Talismans come in two variants. Talismans & *Slimefun* Talismans. While both of those essentially serve the same purpose, regular Talismans are much more robust than *Slimefun* talismans.  Where's the catch? Slimefun Talismans are much easier to obtain, costing you some levels (trust me, you'll be able to earn a lot of xp once you get into PvE) and some materials while regular Talismans offer you much higher benefits, for a higher cost. Slimefun Talismans are **not** listed here, as they are available on the Slimefun guidebook (the book you get when you join the server for the first time) and therefore I do not see a reason to re-list them here. Below, you will find a list of *Regular* Talismans with their benefits.

!!! tip hint important
    You can open a menu with a list of all regular Talismans alongside a bag to store them by running the command `/talismansmenu`

### Extended Armory
Extended Armory is the general name I've given to armor & weapon pieces that you can craft using items from Bosses and other extremely rare items. Those armor pieces can be worn partially, although, they will give massive stat boosts when worn as a set. As a bonus, you can upgrade Extended Armory pieces using **Upgrade Crystals** from leather all the way over to Manyullyn/Exotic.

Weapons are extremely limited as of now, but more may come in the future.

## World Generation & Hostile Mob Changes

### World Generation
The world, in all dimensions, have been overhauled to provide a more unusual survival experience. You will find more loot and naturally, more enemies guarding them as you thread those dimensions.
#### Custom World Generation
You might be familiar with the name "Terralith", it's a popular world generation datapack and we will be using it for this server. Seasons were altered to be compatible with Terralith and almost every terralith biome will respond to the current season. This generation features a variety of things ranging from 1.18 Lush caves, new cave height (goes down below Y=0), goats, powdered snow and more.
#### Custom Nether & End
When the server starts, you are free to go to any dimension you wish to go to. There are no restrictions, because those dimensions are also custom and you will feel the difficulty of them if you go early. That is why you're recommended to go there later in your playthrough, preferably with one or more people by your side.
End is revamped to make you feel like a meaningless pebble in vast nothingness, and will feature (massive) new biomes just like nether.
### Livemap (Dynmap)
There is a livemap that updates to the state of the world (seasons, new builds, terrain changes etc.) and can be accessed [here](http://151.80.47.38:8123/). 3D (isometric) view takes more time to render, so you're advised to use flat view (2D)

You can use this map to find a good place to yoink resources in, or follow other people vibing around. 
the world is 10kx10k and the map follows the same radius, displaying everything available to us as they are discovered on the map.

### Hostile Mob Changes
To tone down the regular monotone-ness (*is that a word?*) of Vanilla Minecraft, I have implemented "some" (*big irony here btw*) custom mobs & bosses that you will encounter. To remain simple for the sake of this being a starter guide, I will only mention that they are *Mobs* that are **extremely challenging.** Want to learn more? Great!
You should ***definitely*** check out the [Advanced Guide](../advanced). As a matter of fact, I strongly recommend reading the Advanced Guide regardless. It has some really **interesting content that you will want to get into**.
