## Skills & Magic

### Skills
Skills are pretty straightforward. Play the game, level yourself up. You really don't need to spend extra effort on things to level yourself up; you will *automatically* gain XP by completing tasks that you usually do (like mining, fishing, fighting, running etc.) Simply play the game as you normally do, and watch certain chores become a lot easier with time.
Each skill comes with 50 levels and each level gives you a little stat boosts alongside other various perks. 
You will unlock some abilities but I'll leave it to you to discover those "abilities". They can be found on `/skills` menu.

*P.S: bedrock players may not be able to open some GUI menus such as `/skills`, sorry*

#### Stats

Each individual skill gives you a tiny boost within 2 selected stats as you level them up. Those stats consist of:

- **Defense** • Reduces Incoming Damage
- **Strength** • Increases Outgoing Damage
- **Crit Chance** • Increases the chance to deal a crit
- **Crit Damage** • Increases crit damage
- **Speed** • Increases movement speed
- **Wisdom** • Increases experience gain


!!! tip hint important 
    All skills and their descriptions can be found on the ***`/skills`*** menu

### Magic
By far my favorite feature, you can cast spells using a personalized wand. First you need to craft a wand (the recipe will be in the recipe book when you can craft one) and then you will need to start earning SpellPoints by slaying mobs using spells (you will have a starter spell.) As you earn SP (spell points), you can upgrade your wand by using the interact button on an enchantment while holding your wand. You can also customize your wand's controls by interacting with the enchanting table. Right click with your wand to cast spells. Level up your spells by killing mobs with your wand. Magic.
## Machinery & Crafting
I've added many items and item modifiers to make this server more RPG-like and offer more freedom on how you approach combat. Below, you will find details on each new mechanic that's been added to the game. Some of them are experimental, so feedback is appreciated. 

### Slimefun
There are custom ores, items, armor, gear and magic stuff you can obtain from a funny plugin called Slimefun. You can build small (or large) pieces of machinery by looking up how to build the crafting stations from `/sf openguide` (or the guide book that's given to you when you first join, they are the same thing) and then create the recipes which are all listed on the slimefun guidebook. there are a lot to discover and you can even craft some vanilla items like tridents, or an elytra. There are also magic stuff that you can get into. I would explain them all one by one, but there is no point bloating this wiki with things that are more fun when discovered on your own. I highly recommend getting into slimefun machinery as soon as you can.

If things added by slimefun are complicated, you can always work together with someone who finds it easy or buy products from another player, forming a proper economy.

### Custom Enchantment Books
There are around 240 custom enchants that can be applied to your weapon. Just like regular enchants, they can be found through enchanting tables, loot chests and villager trades. You can combine most of those enchants, but if you would like to see what conflicts with an enchant of your choice; run the command `/enchantinfo <enchant name>` or do `/enchants` to open a menu with a list of all possible enchants, spells curses and artifacts.

#### Enchants
Most of the books added through this plugin are enchants. They come in various shape on form, for a variety of tools; but what they do is simple, offer you a different way to play the game, be it through changing how you mine blocks or how you fight mobs. Enchants also have a few rarities, mentioned in [the Enchants List](../lists/enchants.md)

#### Spells 
Spells are not very common, and they offer less than enchants. They essentially apply a "skill" to your sword which you can use by using the interact button (right click by default). Some spells come with cooldowns, and they cannot be spammed.

#### Artifacts
Artifacts apply visual changes to your tools. Sword artifacts activate on hitting mobs, pickaxe artifacts activate upon mining rare ores and so on. There is **1** rare armor artifact that is not mentioned in the wiki, whoever finds it (feel free to try as many times as you want) is in for a reward of their choice. :)

#### Curses
Nothing fancy, very similar to vanilla curses. They render your tools somewhat usable. Why would you apply one to your tools? Who knows. Curses will not come from enchanting tables and can be only obtained through loot chests/villager trades.

### Reforges
Reforges are enchant-like enhancements to your tools that need to be applied manually through a menu. You can run `/reforges` to open a menu where you can apply reforge stones.

The reforge menu is very simple to understand. The glass on the side goes green when there is a valid item that can be reforged in the left slot
*The anvil will show helpful messages.*

**Step One**
To reforge an item, put it on the left side of the menu. The right side is for reforge stones, which will be explained in the next section.

**Step Two**
The glass will then go green to indicate that a valid item has been entered.
*All reforgable items will say so in their lore (hover your cursor over the item).*

**Step Three**
Click the button to reforge the item, paying its cost. The price increases by a factor of 1.15x every time the same item is reforged.
## World Generation & Hostile Mob Changes


### World Generation
The world, in all dimensions, have been overhauled to provide a more unusual survival experience. You will find more loot and naturally, more enemies guarding them as you thread those dimensions.
#### Custom World Generation
You might be familiar with the name "Terralith", it's a popular world generation datapack and we will be using it for this server. Seasons were altered to be compatible with Terralith and almost every terralith biome will respond to the current season. This generation features a variety of things ranging from 1.18 Lush caves, new cave height (goes down below Y=0), goats, powdered snow and more.
#### Custom Nether & End
When the server starts, you are free to go to any dimension you wish to go to. There are no restrictions, because those dimensions are also custom and you will feel the difficulty of them if you go early. That is why you're recommended to go there later in your playthrough, preferably with one or more people by your side.
End is revamped to make you feel like a meaningless pebble in vast nothingness, and will feature (massive) new biomes just like nether.
#### Livemap (Dynmap)
There is a livemap that updates to the state of the world (seasons, new builds, terrain changes etc.) and can be accessed [here](http://151.80.47.38:8123/). 3D (isometric) view takes more time to render, so you're advised to use flat view (2D)

You can use this map to find a good place to yoink resources in, or follow other people vibing around. 
the world is 10kx10k and the map follows the same radius, displaying everything available to us as they are discovered on the map.

#### Dynamic Mob Difficulty 
Yet another simplex mechanic which forces mobs to spawn with higher levels as you go further away from spawn. Their stats were balanced in order to feel harder, but not impossible. There is not a hard cap for maximum mob level.  Bosses are not affected by this mechanic.

## Dungeons & Adventurer's Guild (and Bosses)
As you fight Elite Mobs and Bosses, you will collect new loot and Elite Coins. You can spend those coins, or sell your gear as well as buy new gear at Adventurer's Guild. At some point, you will need to level up your adventurer rank to attempt to fight better bosses, because the game hardlocks you from doing so unless you rank up.

There is currently only one dungeon, named Sewers, but you are requested not to enter it as it is planned to be a community event where we can hopefully tackle the dungeon all together. I unfortunately don't have time to create any new dungeons, but if you happen to build one; let me know and we can add it to the server as an actual dungeon.

### Bosses
You will notice mobs which spawn with larger health pools or overall higher stats ranging from defense to damage & range. Those are bosses.  You will notice them most likely by their aura which usually has a meaning, for example:

- Floating Anvils: Doesn't take knockback.
- Floating Arrows: Doesn't take arrow damage.
- Floating Glasspanes: This boss is invisible (creepers are a pain.)
- Floating Fire Particles: This mob wants to grill your buttcheeks.

"Bosses" from the plugin are divided into two categories, **Elite Mobs** & **Bosses**.
**Elitemobs** are regular which have higher stats and possibly an aura. They have a base chance of dropping loot and they scale to your threat level (more about that later)

**Bosses** also appear as regular mobs, but they usually have better gear and visible particle effects alongside abilities to make you feel pain. When a boss spawns in the world, you will see a notification in chat alongside an option to track them. They are usually extremely challenging and definitely should not be fought alone unless you have good gear.

### Guild Tier System
The guild tier loot limiter limits the best loot a player can loot based on their guild tier.
Math behind this system is roughly like this:

```sh 
[(Guild Tier) * 10]
```
So for example, at tier 5 you will be able to obtain up to tier 50 loot and mob level will be capped at 50.
