Those are the the things that require little to no explanation, but were still documented for convenience. If you need anything else that's not here to be, well, be here; please let me know on discord. 

### Singleplayer Sleep
When one person sleeps, it skips the night. No questions asked.

## Backpacks
YOU CAN CRAFT 6 TIERS OF BACKPACKS YEEHAW HOW COOL IS THAT
Their recipes are in `/bprecipe`, and all backpacks come with liquid tanks to store your liquids without wasting shit ton of space on individual buckets. You can't put backpacks in backpacks, sucks I know. 

**Notes**
>*Rev 3.1: Both `/bprecipe` and `/bbp recipe` are valid commands. `/bprecipe` was an alias added later to make the command more convenient.*
>*Rev 3.2: Backpack recipes will now appear in the crafting book when you open a crafting table.*


## Custom Heads
If you are a builder looking to spice up your build, there are around 38k playerheads with custom textures at your disposal.
You can do `/hdb` to view them all

## Reviving Players [Experimental]
You will die. A lot. The bosses and even their elite (weake counterparts) are strong and they *will* kill you. But be not afraid! You can always revive your friends when they die, or then can revive you when you, well, **die**.
The process goes as follows: When a player is killed, they are not actually killed; they will be placed into a bleedout period where other players can try and revive the player who is downed. To revive a player, you need to hold sneak while standing really close to them until they are revived and they get back up. When a player is revived, they will be at half a heart. Do note that there is a bleedout timer, so you cannot leave the players hanging forever. After 1.5 minutes, the player will die. To end your own suffering, you can press sneak (shift) to end bleedout and die as intended.
## Smoothtimber
You can take down entire trees[^1] by chopping down the bottom block
If you don't want the whole tree to go down just shift/sneak while breaking the block

## Seasons
Pretty much a gimmick feature, but you will notice different things in the world such as air/block colors changing, random animals, berries or flowers spawning and such. If you tame an animal in a season, they will despawn when that season ends. If you breed two animals, the baby stays and parents leave to buy milk.

## Editing sign contents
Do `/signedit` and click on a sign to change what's written on the sign.
May not work on Bedrock clients.

## Interaction Visualiser 
You will be seeing some funny chest/enchantment table and other crafting station animations usually showing you the progress of the said station or just looks cool.
If you, *per chance*, don't like this, you can disable it by `/iv toggle all <all>/<specific block> <true>/<false>` 
***Don't forget to choose between optional statements. while executing the command.***

## Pet Related

####Auto-Teleport
Pets will automatically be teleported to their owners upon chunk unload **if** they are standing. This will make it for pets to follow you while travelling.

### Training Pets
You can capture and train a pet to fight for you, or assist you in other ways. Details in [Pets Guide](../pets.md)

### Tamable Foxes
You can now tame foxes, using chicken, to follow you attack mobs (or players that have attacked you) on your behalf. 

## Shulker Nerf
Shulker bullets will no longer create new shulkers upon hitting other shulkers. This fixes a dupe glitch anda performance issue.

## Instant nether portals [Experimental]
You will not go through nether portals instantly. No more teleportation delay with swirly effects.

### Brewing Alcoholic Beverages
Pretty simple yet complex. Read [here](brewing.md) if you are interested.

[^1]: This will only work on logs which generate naturally. If you would like to take down a custom-built tree or a pillar in your base made out of logs, you will need to do that manually. There are no workarounds.
