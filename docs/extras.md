Those are the the things that require little to no explanation, but were still documented for convenience. If you need anything else that's not here to be, well, be here; please let me know on discord. 

### Singleplayer Sleep
When one person sleeps, it skips the night no questions asked

### Custom Heads
If you are a builder looking to spice up your build, there are around 38k playerheads with custom textures at your disposal.
You can do /hdb to view them all

### Smoothtimber*
You can take down entire trees by chopping down the bottom block
If you don't want the whole tree to go down just shift/sneak while breaking the block

*: Logs placed by players do not go down when broken.

### Seasons
Pretty much a gimmick feature, but you will notice different things in the world such as air/block colors changing, random animals, berries or flowers spawning and such. If you tame an animal in a season, they will despawn when that season ends. If you breed two animals, the baby stays and parents leave to buy milk.

### Editing sign contents
Do `/signedit` and click on a sign to change what's written on the sign.
May not work on Bedrock clients.

### Interaction Visualiser 
You will be seeing some funny chest/enchantment table and other crafting station animations usually showing you the progress of the said station or just looks cool.
If you, *per chance*, don't like this, you can disable it by `/iv toggle all <all>/<specific block> <true>/<false>` 
***Don't forget to choose between optional statements. while executing the command.***

###  Brewing Alcoholic Beverages
Pretty simple yet complex. Read [here](brewing.md) if you are interested.
