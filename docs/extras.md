Those are the the things that require little to no explanation, but were still documented for convenience. If you need anything else that's not here to be, well, be here; please let me know on discord. 

## Tweaks

### Singleplayer Sleep
When one person sleeps, it skips the night. No questions asked.

### Armored  Elytra
You can drop an elytra and a chestplate on an anvil to merge. To merge, place your "Armored Elytra" on a grindstone.

### Enchanting Table Tweaks

* Once you place some lapis into your enchanting table, it'll remain there until someone (hopefully you) picks it back up.
* Rightclick an enchanting table with bottles to fill it with xp.

### Compass Tweaks
* Compass can now work in nether and end too, pointing towards the portal you entered from, this will only work if you have a compass in main hands (inventory or hotbar won't work.)
* Right clicking the bed with compass in your main hand will start pointing towards bed location.

### Faster Leaf Decay
Leaf blocks  will decay faster once their connection to the log has been severed.

### Hoe Tweaks
* Breaking grass or crops with a hoe (while sneaking) will break a 3x3 of them. A Diamond & Netherite Hoe will break a 5x5 instead.
* If you put Fortune on the hoe, it'll also apply that effect to everything it breaks.
## Utilities

### Custom Heads
If you are a builder looking to spice up your build, there are around 38k playerheads with custom textures at your disposal.
You can do `/hdb` to view them all

### Sign Editor
Do `/signedit` and click on a sign to change what's written on the sign.
May not work on Bedrock clients.

### Instant nether Portals 
*[Experimental]*
You will not go through nether portals instantly. No more teleportation delay with swirly effects.

### Extendable Ladders
Right clicking a ladder with another one will place it, allowing you to drop ladders down without risking falling to your death.

### Cancelling Vines 
*(not on Twitter)*
The tip of a vine can now be burnt with a Flint and Steel, effectively preventing it from growing.

### Throwel Tool
A Trowel tool can be crafted with Iron and Sticks. The Trowel, when right clicked, will place a random block from your hotbar, making it useful for ruins or paths.

### Shulker & Echest Preview
`Shift+Left Clicking` a Shulker Box or an Ender-Chest while pointing at air will display its contents without opening it.

!!! warning ""
    For Bedrock players, Shift refers to crouch and Left Click is, well, literally clicking.

## Misc
### Interaction Visualiser 
You will be seeing some funny chest/enchantment table and other crafting station animations usually showing you the progress of the said station or just looks cool.
If you, *per chance*, don't like this, you can disable it by `/iv toggle all <all>/<specific block> <true>/<false>` 
***Don't forget to choose between optional statements. while executing the command.***

### Shulker Nerf
Shulker bullets will no longer create new shulkers upon hitting other shulkers. This fixes a *dupe glitch* and a *performance issue*.

### Brewing Alcoholic Beverages
Pretty simple yet complex. Read [here](brewing.md) if you are interested.

## Pet Related
### Pet Auto-Teleport
Pets will automatically be teleported to their owners upon chunk unload **if** they are standing. This will make it for pets to follow you while travelling.

### Training Pets
You can capture and train a pet to fight for you, or assist you in other ways. Details in [Pets Guide](../pets)

### Tamable Foxes
You can now tame foxes, using chicken, to follow you attack mobs (or players that have attacked you) on your behalf.
