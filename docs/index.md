# Welcome to the **ultimate** documentation website.
*Made by yours truely.*

There are quite a lot of features in the server, and some *-if not most-* of them are complicated enough to require an explanation. I will be providing explanations for those mechanis in this guide the best I can.

Please visit [the **Starter Guide**](guide.md) to learn more about the main features of the server. If you want to learn the extra features which you can figure out without any introduction, do visit [Extras](extras.md). Brewing is briefly mentioned in the [Extras](extras.md) guide, but since it requires a full page to be explained throughoutly, you can visit [the **Brewing Guide**.](brewing.md) if you are interested in learning how it works.

*Some things may not be on the list but still in game. I will try to record things that I might have missed as soon as possible, but forgive me if I miss anything.*
