There are quite a lot of features in the server, and some -if not most- of them are complicatede enough to require an explanation. I will be providing those explanation in this guide.

Please visit [the Starter Guide](guide.md) to learn more about the main features of the server. If you want to learn the extra features which you can figure out without any introduction, do visit [Extras](extras.md). It is already mentioned in [Extras](extras.md) but if you are here for the Brewing guide; you can visit [the Brewing Guide](brewing.md)
