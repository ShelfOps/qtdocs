Welcome to the ***ultimate*** documentation website for qtcraft, qtdocs.

*Made by yours truely.*

Let's be honest, almost all of us have been frustrated by how content-dry Minecraft gets at times. But fret not! Your friendly neighborhood developer, raf, has been planning on making a server and after almost a full month of trial & error; I present to you: **qtcraft**.

This server will aim to offer you a brand new Minecraft experience within the very game you've gotten used to playing, you guessed it, Minecraft. To -in my words- "patch" the lack of enjoyable activities within the game ,especially after a few hundred hours of playtime, I have implemented a whole bunch of mechanics that are designed to make the game last longer and make your experience more fun while it is.


There are *quite a lot* of features in the server, and some *-if not most-* of them are complicated enough to require an explanation. I will be providing explanations for those mechanics in this guide the best I can.

Everything you need to know when you first join will be covered in the [**Starter Guide**](../guide) and if you are interesting in getting involved with the rest of the activities (*I strongly recommend that you do*), consider taking a peek at the [**Advanced Guide**](../advanced).

If it is a list of Enchants/Talismans/Reforges/Armor you need (all covered in the Starter Guide), you can find a full list under the lists section within their on respective pages. 

- [Enchants](../enchants)
- [Reforges](../reforges)
- [Talismans](../talismans)
- [Armor](../armor)

There is also content that could not fit any of those above, and received their own page. If you are interested in learning about the miscellaneous tweaks and features I have specificly added to make certain things more convenient, then you will definitely be interested in the [**Extras Guide**](../extras).

*Some things may not be on the list but still in game. I will try to record things that I might have missed as soon as possible, but forgive me if I miss anything.*
