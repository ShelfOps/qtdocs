# Welcome to the **ultimate** documentation website.

There are quite a lot of features in the server, and some -if not most- of them are complicated enough to require an explanation. I will be providing those explanation in this guide.

Please visit [the Starter Guide](guide.md) to learn more about the main features of the server. If you want to learn the extra features which you can figure out without any introduction, do visit [Extras](extras.md). It is already mentioned in [Extras](extras.md) but if you are here for the Brewing guide; you can visit [the Brewing Guide.](brewing.md)

Some things may not be on the list but still in game. I will try to record things that I might have missed as soon as possible, but forgive me if I miss anything.
