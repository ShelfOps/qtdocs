As you spend time on the server, you will be receiving some Mystery Boxes. If you were wondering what you were doing with them, which is probably why you're here, this is the correct page.

## Opening Mystery Boxes
If you have some mystery boxes that you want to unlock, head over to Adventurer's Guild using the command `/ag` and locate the two ender chests that say "Mystery Vault" above them. Right click one, and choose the box you want to open. After a short animation, your box will open and provide you your new cosmetics.

## Equipping Cosmetics
All cosmetics you've found will be on the `/cosmetics` menu. Open the menu and choose your cosmetics, the big red glass block disables your cosmetics.
