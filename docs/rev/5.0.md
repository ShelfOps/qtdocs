# Revision 5.0 Notes
- Complete site overhaul
I can't emphasize how proud I am of this change. I've completely rewritten mkdocs' search system to increase its speed by almost 110% and improved its accuracy to find words and phrases easier. Translation support is prepared and soon you'll be able to read the website in your own langÄ±age, if I manage to automate the translations. 
- New page structure
I've moved some headers under other headers, combiting them and improving site navigation
- Removed Leveled Dragon information (removed in server update)
- Replaced site fonts
- Fixed SSL settings
- Added Enchants, Talismans, Reforges & Armors lists 
- Fixed a whole bunch of typos and grammar errors
- Fixed some punctuation errors
- Reduced website size to improve loading
- Added blogging support for seemingly no reason, may come in handy later maybe?
