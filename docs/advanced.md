## Magic
By far my favorite feature, you can cast spells using a personalized wand. First you need to craft a **Wand** or a **Spellbook** (the recipe will be in the recipe book when you can craft one) and then you will need to start earning Spell Points (SP) by slaying mobs using your spells (you will have a starter spell, magic missile.) As you earn SP , you can upgrade your wand by using the interact button on an enchantment while holding your wand or customize it's appearance. You can also *customize your wand's controls* by interacting with the enchanting table. Level up your spells by killing mobs with your wand. *Magic.*

## Waystones
Waystones are, simply put, warps that are controlled by players. Be it public, or private. Once you place a *public*  Waystone, anyone with another Waystone placed can navigate between their Waystone and yours.

Public Waystones are a bit trickier. To return to Private Waystones, you will need to craft a Teleportation Book and right click the Private Waystone you would like to return later, with the book in your hand. The Waystone is now marked on your book and you will be teleported to the Waystone you've marked when you right click with the book. (More details are on Book's tooltips.)

!!! warning
    Remember, teleportation books are **consumed** when they are used. So you will need to craft multiple ones if you would like to actively use your Private Waystone.


## Dungeons & Adventurer's Guild (and Bosses)
Aside from *vanilla* Minecraft mobs, you will encounter **Elite** Mobs and eventually, Bosses.
As you take down Elite Mobs and Bosses, you will collect new loot and Elite Coins. You can spend those coins, or sell your gear as well as buy new gear at Adventurer's Guild. At some point, you will need to level up your adventurer rank to attempt to fight better bosses, because the game hardlocks you from doing so unless you rank up.

There is currently only one Dungeon, named Sewers and it will give you a general idea of how Dungeons will go in general. After you unlock **Apprentice Rank** in **Adventurer's Guild** I unfortunately don't have time to create any new dungeons, but if you happen to build one; let me know and we can add it to the server as an actual dungeon.

### Elite Mobs
 Elite Mobs, as mentioned before, are mobs that you will encounter while exploring the wilderness. They can be distinguished by their larger healthpool and higher damage. You might also notice them by their aura, which usually has a meaning. For example:

- **Floating Anvils** » Doesn't take knockback.
- **Floating (Spectral) Arrows** » Doesn't take arrow damage.
- **Floating Glasspanes** » This mob is invisible (creepers are a pain.)
- **Floating Fire Particles** » This mob wants to grill your hecking buttcheeks.

Elite Mobs  will occasionally drop Procedurely Generated Loot which you can either choose to equip, or sell for a small sum of Elite Coins.

### Bosses
**Bosses** will not spawn as randomly or as frequently as Elite Mobs. They spawn somewhat "event" based with a timer that decides if a boss should be spawned or not When a boss spawns in the world, you will see a notification in chat alongside an option to track them. They are usually *extremely challenging* and definitely should not be fought alone unless you have very good gear.

### Adventurer's Guild 
Adventurer's Guild is where everything breaks down. This zone, which is also the Japanese-looking area you've spawned in, essentially acts as the main hub for everything Boss & Elite Mobs related. Here you can increase your [Guild Tier](#guild-tier-system), exchange Elite/Boss Gear


#### Guild Tier System
The guild tier loot limiter limits the best loot a player can loot based on their guild tier.
Math behind this system is roughly like this:

```sh 
[(Guild Tier) * 10]
```

So for example, at tier 5 you will be able to obtain up to tier 50 loot and mob level will be capped at 50.

Moreover, you will also gain bonuses for being in higher guild tiers. No spoilers, I'm not sharing what those bonuses are >:)

### Adventurers Guild NPCs

[^1]: This is not really a word, lmao. "Elite Combat" is what I refer to combat against Elite Mobs & Bosses as. You are welcome for the quick english lesson.

### Summonable Bosses
Unlike Bosses that spawn naturally (see above), you will need to craft the summoning item for those bosses. The summoning items are *costy*, but the drops from those bosses can be used to upgrade some pieces of the [Extended Armory](../armor) pieces.

The whole process is easy. Summon the boss, slay it. Collect the loot. Simple as that. 
You will later use the loot you've collected in various craftable items, such as armor upgrades. But I'll be leaving it to you to discover those craftables, good luck :)
