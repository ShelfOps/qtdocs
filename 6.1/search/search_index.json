Made by yours truely. Let's be honest, almost all of us have been frustrated by how content-dry Minecraft gets at times. But fret not! Your friendly neighborhood developer, raf, has been planning on making a server and after almost a full month of trial & error; I present to you: qtcraft . This server will aim to offer you a brand new Minecraft experience within the very game you've gotten used to playing, you guessed it, Minecraft. To -in my words- \"patch\" the lack of enjoyable activities within the game ,especially after a few hundred hours of playtime, I have implemented a whole bunch of mechanics that are designed to make the game last longer and make your experience more fun while it is. There are quite a lot of features in the server, and some -if not most- of them are complicated enough to require an explanation. I will be providing explanations for those mechanics in this guide the best I can. Everything you need to know when you first join will be covered in the Starter Guide and if you are interesting in getting involved with the rest of the activities ( I strongly recommend that you do ), consider taking a peek at the Advanced Guide . If it is a list of Enchants/Talismans/Reforges/Armor you need (all covered in the Starter Guide), you can find a full list under the lists section within their on respective pages. Enchants Reforges Talismans Armor There is also content that could not fit any of those above, and received their own page. If you are interested in learning about the miscellaneous tweaks and features I have specificly added to make certain things more convenient, then you will definitely be interested in the Extras Guide . Some things may not be on the list but still in game. I will try to record things that I might have missed as soon as possible, but forgive me if I miss anything.","title":"Home"},{"location":"advanced/","text":"If you've read the Started Guide , experienced its contents first hand and came back eager to see more; this is the correct place. This page describes more advanced content you can choose to try out with higher risks, higher rewards and overall; more fun. Note that some ( cough dungeons cough ) coutent are designed to be experienced in the endgame so you may have trouble trying them out with your starter gear. You have been warned. Magic Waystones Dungeons, Adventurer's Guild & Bosses Magic \u00b6 By far my favorite feature, you can cast spells using a personalized wand. First you need to craft a Wand or a Spellbook (the recipe will be in the recipe book when you can craft one) and then you will need to start earning Spell Points (SP) by slaying mobs using your spells (you will have a starter spell, magic missile.) As you earn SP , you can upgrade your wand by using the interact button on an enchantment while holding your wand or customize it's appearance. You can also customize your wand's controls by interacting with the enchanting table. Level up your spells by killing mobs with your wand. Magic. Waystones \u00b6 Waystones are, simply put, warps that are controlled by players. Be it public, or private. Once you place a public Waystone, anyone with another Waystone placed can navigate between their Waystone and yours. Public Waystones are a bit trickier. To return to Private Waystones, you will need to craft a Teleportation Book and right click the Private Waystone you would like to return later, with the book in your hand. The Waystone is now marked on your book and you will be teleported to the Waystone you've marked when you right click with the book. (More details are on Book's tooltips.) Warning Remember, teleportation books are consumed when they are used. So you will need to craft multiple ones if you would like to actively use your Private Waystone. Dungeons & Adventurer's Guild (and Bosses) \u00b6 Aside from vanilla Minecraft mobs, you will encounter Elite Mobs and eventually, Bosses. As you take down Elite Mobs and Bosses, you will collect new loot and Elite Coins. You can spend those coins, or sell your gear as well as buy new gear at Adventurer's Guild. At some point, you will need to level up your adventurer rank to attempt to fight better bosses, because the game hardlocks you from doing so unless you rank up. There is currently only one Dungeon, named Sewers and it will give you a general idea of how Dungeons will go in general. After you unlock Apprentice Rank in Adventurer's Guild I unfortunately don't have time to create any new dungeons, but if you happen to build one; let me know and we can add it to the server as an actual dungeon. Elite Mobs \u00b6 Elite Mobs, as mentioned before, are mobs that you will encounter while exploring the wilderness. They can be distinguished by their larger healthpool and higher damage. You might also notice them by their aura, which usually has a meaning. For example: Floating Anvils \u00bb Doesn't take knockback. Floating (Spectral) Arrows \u00bb Doesn't take arrow damage. Floating Glasspanes \u00bb This mob is invisible (creepers are a pain.) Floating Fire Particles \u00bb This mob wants to grill your hecking buttcheeks. Elite Mobs will occasionally drop Procedurely Generated Loot which you can either choose to equip, or sell for a small sum of Elite Coins. Bosses \u00b6 Bosses will not spawn as randomly or as frequently as Elite Mobs. They spawn somewhat \"event\" based with a timer that decides if a boss should be spawned or not When a boss spawns in the world, you will see a notification in chat alongside an option to track them. They are usually extremely challenging and definitely should not be fought alone unless you have very good gear. Adventurer's Guild \u00b6 Adventurer's Guild is where everything breaks down. This zone, which is also the Japanese-looking area you've spawned in, essentially acts as the main hub for everything Boss & Elite Mobs related. Here you can increase your Guild Tier , exchange Elite/Boss Gear Guild Tier System \u00b6 The guild tier loot limiter limits the best loot a player can loot based on their guild tier. Math behind this system is roughly like this: [( Guild Tier ) * 10 ] So for example, at tier 5 you will be able to obtain up to tier 50 loot and mob level will be capped at 50. Moreover, you will also gain bonuses for being in higher guild tiers. No spoilers, I'm not sharing what those bonuses are >:) Adventurers Guild NPCs \u00b6 Guild Attendant (for upgrading guild ranks) Located within the Main Building Blacksmith (for buying procedurally generated items and selling drops from elite mobs) Located within the tower connected to the Main Building Special Blacksmith (for buying custom items and selling drops from elite mobs) Located within the tower connected to the Main Building Quest Giver (for browsing and accepting quests) (currently unimplemented) Located within the Main Building Combat Instructor (for giving tips about Elite Combat 1 ) Located outside the Main Building, close to the Collesium. Barkeep (currently unimplemented) Located within the Main Building Summonable Bosses \u00b6 Unlike Bosses that spawn naturally (see above), you will need to craft the summoning item for those bosses. The summoning items are costy , but the drops from those bosses can be used to upgrade some pieces of the Extended Armory pieces. The whole process is easy. Summon the boss, slay it. Collect the loot. Simple as that. You will later use the loot you've collected in various craftable items, such as armor upgrades. But I'll be leaving it to you to discover those craftables, good luck :) This is not really a word, lmao. \"Elite Combat\" is what I refer to combat against Elite Mobs & Bosses as.

Fermenting \u00b6 Step one consists of Fermenting the fresh Ingredients. Place Cauldron over a Fire or other heat source Fill it with water Add Ingredients with a rightclick Wait a few minutes while they ferment Fill in glass bottles Use a clock on a cauldron, if you want to know the time the ingredients have been fermenting. Distilling \u00b6 Some Recipes don't need distilling. 1. Put the bottle with ferment into the brewing stand 2. Put glowstone dust as filter on top into the brewing stand (The filter will not be consumed) Aging \u00b6 A barrel is needed for aging. Minecraft Barrel | 6 Slots Starting in 1.14 the Minecraft-Barrel can be used for aging of a few brews. Simply craft and place the barrel and put the brews inside. You can also build bigger barrels. They can be built in two ways: Small barrel | 9 Slots Use 8 wooden stairs to build a barrel shape. Place a Sign on the lower right side and write \"Barrel\" in the upper Line: Message \"Barrel created\" should appear. Big barrel | 27 Slots Use 5 Fences, 16 Wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape. Attach a Spigot (Fence) and a Sign that has \"Barrel\" written on it: Message \"Barrel created\" should appear You may remove the Sign from the Big Barrel after creating it. Open the Barrel by clicking on it. Put the Bottles into the Barrels for aging. For every Minecraft Day, the brews will age a year. Depending on the Recipe, the Type of wood used for building the barrel may alter the quality of the aged Brew. The Minecraft-barrel is always of wood type oak. Locking the Barrel \u00b6 The Barrels can be locked and Protected by a variety of Plugins. To Lock your Barrel you can use: * [LWC Extended](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lwc-extended.69551/) Just use /cprivate on the sign of the Barrel * [BlockLocker](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/blocklocker.3268/) When creating the Barrel, write `[private]` on the first line and `Barrel` on the last line of the sign Supported Plugins for region Protection are: * WorldGuard * GriefPrevention * Towny * GMInventories * Landlord * ProtectionStones * ClaimChunk * Residence * And many others. For \"Residence\" and if your plugin doensn't work with Brewery, enable `useVirtualChestPerms: true` in the config For scripts, or to implement support for Barrels, the [BarrelAccessEvent](https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/blob/master/src/com/dre/brewery/api/events/barrel/BarrelAccessEvent.java) from Brewery can be used. Drinking \u00b6 The Amount of Alcohol inside the Brew will be applied to the player when drinking. Depending on the quality of it, that may have different effects. The Player may not be able to walk normally anymore, he will weave, making it almost impossible to walk straight Effects like Blindness, Confusion, Poison etc. occur The Chat will be altered depending on drunkeness, many things players write may be incomprehensible, sometimes it seems senseless Is the Alcohol particularly strong, it may have poisonous effects After drinking a lot, there is a chance of vomiting When logging off, the player may have difficulties reaching his character, thus some loggins shortly after may be denied After Overdrinking the player may faint (Disconnecting) Brew Sealing - for shop plugins \u00b6 You can just give your created Brews to other Players and they might even put them back into a Barrel to keep ageing them. But most Shop-Plugins require sold items to be exactly equal and this is where sealing comes in. Imagine it like putting a seal on the bottle. To sell Brews using Shop-Plugins, you will need to seal them using the Brew Sealing Table. It is crafted with 2 Bottles over 4 Planks Putting a Brew into the Sealing table will equalise it, making it equal to other Brews that have been brewed similarly. Sealed Brews cannot be aged or modified any further and they don't show their details anymore Only available on 1.14 and up. Use /brew seal on 1.13. Getting Sober \u00b6 After drinking it takes a while until the alcohol is completely gone. During that time the alcohol level is steadily decreasing. Also it can be decreased through consuming of items defined in the config. When logging off extremely drunk, it may happen that, if the player logs back in after a while, they may find themselves at an completely unknown Place in the middle of nowhere having no idea how he got there. But if they log back in after some hours or next morning, they will find themselves at /home, again without any memories. Also if the Alcohol was not of best quality, the player may face some bad type of hangover (slowness and hunger). Some recipes are more difficult to master, others rather easy. Thats also why some of the recipes here are kept a bit more vague.

From here onwards, you will be spending most of your time in the wilderness, or Dungeons, but more about that later. Let's get to \"how to start\" To teleport to the wilderness and begin your adventure, you will need to go talk to the \" Sorcerer \" NPC located a few steps away from you down the path. Simply right click to the Sorcerer and stand still for a few seconds. After a short teleportation delay, you will find yourself in the wilderness. Great, that was step one. From here onwards, you can begin your Survival adventure. Of course, with extra features. Let's talk more about those. There are \"few\" unusual key elements that you will need to pay attention to. Mainly: Skills & Evolutions Reviving Players Machinery & Crafting Enchants, Reforges, Talismans & Extended Armory World Generation & Mob Changes Skills & Evolutions \u00b6 Skills \u00b6 Skills are pretty straightforward. Play the game, level yourself up. You really don't need to spend extra effort on things to level yourself up; you will automatically gain XP by completing tasks that you usually do (like mining, fishing, fighting, running etc.) Simply play the game as you normally do, and watch certain chores become a lot easier with time. Each skill comes with 50 levels and each level gives you a little stat boosts alongside other various perks. By default, those are the skills you can level up P.S: bedrock players may not be able to open some GUI menus such as /skills , sorry Skills play a major role in your gameplay. You will notice how the difficulty of the game will go up or down based on which skills you've chosen to level up. I recommend keeping an eye on and possibly prioritizing the stats certain skills provide bonuses on to be able to tackle certain challenges, such as Dungeons , become a lot easier. Below you will find the benefits of each stat, hope it helps you plan out your journey. Stats \u00b6 Each individual skill gives you a tiny boost within 2 selected stats as you level them up. Those stats consist of: Defense \u2022 Reduces Incoming Damage Strength \u2022 Increases Outgoing Damage Crit Chance \u2022 Increases the chance to deal a crit Crit Damage \u2022 Increases crit damage Speed \u2022 Increases movement speed Wisdom \u2022 Increases experience gain Tip All skills and their descriptions can be found on the /skills menu. Evolutions \u00b6 Evolutions introduce the mechanic of evolution to Minecraft, evolving unlocks new skills and boosts for yourself. Improvise, adapt, overcome. There are 6 evolution environments. With them being: Earth Nether End Ocean Cave Sky Each of these environments have unique skills that you can unlock by \u201cevolving\u201d in those environments. You evolve by gaining \"Evolotion Energy\". By spending time and slaying mobs in an environment you gain energy in that environment. Each skill requires a certain amount of energy to unlock. Hover over the book icon in each of the environment menus to view all of the ways to gain energy. Tip All evolutions and their descriptions can be found on the /evo menu menu. Reviving Players [Experimental] \u00b6 You will die. A lot. The bosses and even their elite (weaker) counterparts are strong and they will kill you. But be not afraid! You can always revive your friends when they die, or then can revive you when you, well, die . The process goes as follows: When a player is killed, they are not actually killed; they will be placed into a bleedout period where other players can try and revive the player who is downed. To revive a player, you need to hold sneak while standing really close to them until they are revived and they get back up. When a player is revived, they will be at half a heart. Do note that there is a bleedout timer, so you cannot leave the players hanging forever. After 1.5 minutes, the player will die. To end your own suffering, you can press Sneak (shift) to end bleedout and die as intended. Lumberjack \u00b6 You can take down entire trees 1 by chopping down the bottom block If you don't want the whole tree to go down just shift/sneak while breaking the block You will not gain Woodcutting XP (See Skills above) from trees that you've chopped down automatically by breaking the bottom block. To level up your Woodcutting skill, you will need to manually chop down each block. Seasons \u00b6 Pretty much a gimmick feature, but you will notice different things in the world such as air/block colors changing, random animals, berries or flowers spawning and such. If you tame an animal in a season, they will despawn when that season ends. If you breed two animals, the baby stays and parents leave to buy milk. Another thing is that there is a small winter mechanic with a temparature mechanic well on the way. Temparatures are not implemented, however, your crops will not grow during winter. Not at all. They will not die , but they will promptly stop growing until the next season (spring.) Machinery & Crafting \u00b6 I've added many items and item modifiers to make this server more RPG-like and offer more freedom on how you approach combat. Below, you will find details on each new mechanic that's been added to the game. Some of them are experimental, so feedback is appreciated. Slimefun \u00b6 There are custom ores, items, armor, gear and magic stuff you can obtain from a funny plugin called Slimefun. You can build small (or large) pieces of machinery by looking up how to build the crafting stations from /sf openguide (or the guide book that's given to you when you first join, they are the same thing) and then create the recipes which are all listed on the slimefun guidebook. there are a lot to discover and you can even craft some vanilla items like tridents, or an elytra. There are also magic stuff that you can get into. I would explain them all one by one, but there is no point bloating this wiki with things that are more fun when discovered on your own. I highly recommend getting into slimefun machinery as soon as you can. If things added by slimefun are complicated, you can always work together with someone who finds it easy or buy products from another player, forming a proper economy. Backpacks \u00b6 YOU CAN CRAFT 6 TIERS OF BACKPACKS YEEHAW HOW COOL IS THAT Their recipes are in /bprecipe , and all backpacks come with liquid tanks to store your liquids without wasting shit ton of space on individual buckets. You can't put backpacks in backpacks, sucks I know. Notes Rev 3.1: Both /bprecipe and /bbp recipe are valid commands. /bprecipe was an alias added later to make the command more convenient. Rev 3.2: Backpack recipes will now appear in the crafting book when you open a crafting table. Enchants, Reforges, Talismans & Extended Armory \u00b6 Custom Enchantment Books \u00b6 There are around 240 custom enchants that can be applied to your weapon. Just like regular enchants, they can be found through enchanting tables, loot chests and villager trades. You can combine most of those enchants, but if you would like to see what conflicts with an enchant of your choice; run the command /enchantinfo <enchant name> or do /enchants to open a menu with a list of all possible enchants, spells curses and artifacts. Enchants \u00b6 Most of the books added through this plugin are enchants. They come in various shape on form, for a variety of tools; but what they do is simple, offer you a different way to play the game, be it through changing how you mine blocks or how you fight mobs. Enchants also have a few rarities, mentioned in the Enchants List . Spells \u00b6 Spells are not very common, and they offer less than enchants. They essentially apply a \"skill\" to your sword which you can use by using the interact button (right click by default). Some spells come with cooldowns, and they cannot be spammed. All Spells, alongside other Enchantment Books, are mentioned in the Enchants List . Artifacts \u00b6 Artifacts apply visual changes to your tools. Sword artifacts activate on hitting mobs, pickaxe artifacts activate upon mining rare ores and so on. There is 1 rare armor artifact that is not mentioned in the wiki, whoever finds it (feel free to try as many times as you want) is in for a reward of their choice. :) Curses \u00b6 Nothing fancy, very similar to vanilla curses. They render your tools somewhat usable. Why would you apply one to your tools? Who knows. Curses will not come from enchanting tables and can be only obtained through loot chests/villager trades. Reforges \u00b6 Reforges are enchant-like enhancements to your tools that need to be applied manually through a menu. You can run /reforges to open a menu where you can apply reforge stones. The reforge menu is very simple to understand. The glass on the side goes green when there is a valid item that can be reforged in the left slot The anvil will show helpful messages. Step One To reforge an item, put it on the left side of the menu. The right side is for reforge stones, which will be explained in the next section. Step Two The glass will then go green to indicate that a valid item has been entered. All reforgable items will say so in their lore (hover your cursor over the item). Step Three Click the button to reforge the item, paying its cost. The price increases by a factor of 1.15x every time the same item is reforged. Talismans \u00b6 Talismans come in two variants. Talismans & Slimefun Talismans. While both of those essentially serve the same purpose, regular Talismans are much more robust than Slimefun talismans. Where's the catch? Slimefun Talismans are much easier to obtain, costing you some levels (trust me, you'll be able to earn a lot of xp once you get into PvE) and some materials while regular Talismans offer you much higher benefits, for a higher cost. Slimefun Talismans are not listed here, as they are available on the Slimefun guidebook (the book you get when you join the server for the first time) and therefore I do not see a reason to re-list them here. Below, you will find a list of Regular Talismans with their benefits. Tip You can open a menu with a list of all regular Talismans alongside a bag to store them by running the command /talismansmenu Extended Armory \u00b6 Extended Armory is the general name I've given to armor & weapon pieces that you can craft using items from Bosses and other extremely rare items. Those armor pieces can be worn partially, although, they will give massive stat boosts when worn as a set. As a bonus, you can upgrade Extended Armory pieces using Upgrade Crystals from leather all the way over to Manyullyn/Exotic. Weapons are extremely limited as of now, but more may come in the future. World Generation & Hostile Mob Changes \u00b6 World Generation \u00b6 The world, in all dimensions, have been overhauled to provide a more unusual survival experience. You will find more loot and naturally, more enemies guarding them as you thread those dimensions. Custom World Generation \u00b6 You might be familiar with the name \"Terralith\", it's a popular world generation datapack and we will be using it for this server. Seasons were altered to be compatible with Terralith and almost every terralith biome will respond to the current season. This generation features a variety of things ranging from 1.18 Lush caves, new cave height (goes down below Y=0), goats, powdered snow and more. Custom Nether & End \u00b6 When the server starts, you are free to go to any dimension you wish to go to. There are no restrictions, because those dimensions are also custom and you will feel the difficulty of them if you go early. That is why you're recommended to go there later in your playthrough, preferably with one or more people by your side. End is revamped to make you feel like a meaningless pebble in vast nothingness, and will feature (massive) new biomes just like nether. Livemap (Dynmap) \u00b6 There is a livemap that updates to the state of the world (seasons, new builds, terrain changes etc.) and can be accessed by running /map in game or the link for the map can be found here . 3D (isometric) view takes more time to render, so you're advised to use flat view (2D) You can use this map to find a good place to yoink resources in, or follow other people vibing around. the world is 10kx10k and the map follows the same radius, displaying everything available to us as they are discovered on the map. Hostile Mob Changes \u00b6 To tone down the regular monotone-ness ( is that a word? ) of Vanilla Minecraft, I have implemented \"some\" ( big irony here btw ) custom mobs & bosses that you will encounter. To remain simple for the sake of this being a starter guide, I will only mention that they are Mobs that are extremely challenging. Want to learn more? Great! You should definitely check out the Advanced Guide . As a matter of fact, I strongly recommend reading the Advanced Guide regardless. It has some really interesting content that you will want to get into . This will only work on logs which generate naturally. If you would like to take down a custom-built tree or a pillar in your base made out of logs, you will need to do that manually. There are no workarounds. \u21a9","title":"Starter Guide"},{"location":"guide/#how-to-start","text":"When you first join the server, you will find yourself in the Hub (which later will be referred to as \"Adventurer's Guild\").

Here is how: How to capture a pet \u00b6 Find the animal you want to capture, it can be any friendly mob that you want to tame. Once you have your target in sight, approach them slowly. You will need them to be below a certain health treshold. I am not going to state it here, as I would like you to experiment with this mechanic. Once the target is below required treshhold, left click them with a leash (lead) and voila; the pet is now yours. Pet Skills \u00b6 Pets may learn several skills such as: Backpack This skill adds a Backpack to your pet. It can be opened by using the /petinventory command. Items in this inventory will not be dropped when the pet dies unless it's enabled in the skilltree skill settings. Items picked up by your pet will be added to this inventory. Line added by skill upgrade will add 9 extra slots (up to 54 slots). Beacon The Beacon skill transforms your pet in a walking and more powerfull beacon. For administration of the buffs the plugin uses a custom menu (see Beacon Buff Selection Menu) that can be opened with the /petbeacon command. By default this skill consumes food when it is active, that means the Saturation-Value decreases continuously while the skill is active. Behavior With this skill you can change the behavior of the pet. There are 5 possible behavior-modes: Friendly -> Doesn't fight, even when attacked by anything Normal -> Like a neutral wolf. Aggressive -> Attacks everything within 15 blocks of the owner. Farm -> Atacks every Monster within 15 blocks of the owner Raid -> like normal but the pet doesn't attack players and their minions Duel -> pets will attack other pets with aktive duel behavior within a 5 block radius To toggle the mode type /petbehavior <normal/friendly/aggressive/farm/raid/duel> . Control With this skill you have more control about where you pet walk and what the pet attacks. To use this you have to rightclick with the Control item anywhere you want the pet has to walk to. The item for this skill is a stick. Damage This skill increases the damage the pet can do. 1 damage point equals to half a heart. Fire With this skill your pet has a chance to set targets on fire for a short period. Heal With this skill your pet heals skill itself every few seconds. Knockback With this skill your pet has a chance to knockback when attacking a target. Life This skill will increase the max hitpoints the pet can have. Lightning With this skill your pet has a chance to let a lightning strike at the target. Pickup With this skill your pet can pickup items (and XP) that lie on the ground. The items are added to the backpack of the pet. This skill can not be activated if the pet doesn't have the Backpack Skill with at least 1 row. Pickup can be enabled/disabled by using /petpickup command. Poison With this skill your pet has a chance to poison targets for a short period. Ranged With this skill your pet will shot projectiles at their targets that cause damage to them. Projectiles Arrow Egg Wither Skull Snowball Small Fireball Large Fireball All projectiles deal the same amount of damage that is set by the skill. The only difference is the trajectory of some projectiles. Ride With this skill you can ride your pet. To mount your pet right-click your pet with a lead.

Once you have your target in sight, approach them slowly. You will need them to be below a certain health treshold. I am not going to state it here, as I would like you to experiment with this mechanic. Once the target is below required treshhold, left click them with a leash (lead) and voila; the pet is now yours.","title":"How to capture a pet"},{"location":"pets/#pet-skills","text":"Pets may learn several skills such as: Backpack This skill adds a Backpack to your pet. It can be opened by using the /petinventory command. Items in this inventory will not be dropped when the pet dies unless it's enabled in the skilltree skill settings. Items picked up by your pet will be added to this inventory. Line added by skill upgrade will add 9 extra slots (up to 54 slots). Beacon The Beacon skill transforms your pet in a walking and more powerfull beacon. For administration of the buffs the plugin uses a custom menu (see Beacon Buff Selection Menu) that can be opened with the /petbeacon command. By default this skill consumes food when it is active, that means the Saturation-Value decreases continuously while the skill is active. Behavior With this skill you can change the behavior of the pet. There are 5 possible behavior-modes: Friendly -> Doesn't fight, even when attacked by anything Normal -> Like a neutral wolf. Aggressive -> Attacks everything within 15 blocks of the owner. Farm -> Atacks every Monster within 15 blocks of the owner Raid -> like normal but the pet doesn't attack players and their minions Duel -> pets will attack other pets with aktive duel behavior within a 5 block radius To toggle the mode type /petbehavior <normal/friendly/aggressive/farm/raid/duel> . Control With this skill you have more control about where you pet walk and what the pet attacks. To use this you have to rightclick with the Control item anywhere you want the pet has to walk to. The item for this skill is a stick. Damage This skill increases the damage the pet can do. 1 damage point equals to half a heart. Fire With this skill your pet has a chance to set targets on fire for a short period. Heal With this skill your pet heals skill itself every few seconds. Knockback With this skill your pet has a chance to knockback when attacking a target. Life This skill will increase the max hitpoints the pet can have. Lightning With this skill your pet has a chance to let a lightning strike at the target. Pickup With this skill your pet can pickup items (and XP) that lie on the ground. The items are added to the backpack of the pet. This skill can not be activated if the pet doesn't have the Backpack Skill with at least 1 row. Pickup can be enabled/disabled by using /petpickup command. Poison With this skill your pet has a chance to poison targets for a short period. Ranged With this skill your pet will shot projectiles at their targets that cause damage to them. Projectiles Arrow Egg Wither Skull Snowball Small Fireball Large Fireball All projectiles deal the same amount of damage that is set by the skill. The only difference is the trajectory of some projectiles. Ride With this skill you can ride your pet. To mount your pet right-click your pet with a lead. The controls while riding your pet is like you would ride a horse. Shield With this skill your pet can shield (some) damage from you and redirect it to itself.
